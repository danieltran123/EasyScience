        <p>Let's learn about finding density! To find density, we have to divide an object's mass and volume.
        <br>
        But to find the mass and volume, we have to use a triple beam balance and a graduated cylinder.</p>

            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p class="explanation">Let's take the blue cube
                in the picture for example, when the blue cube<br> is placed on the triple beam
                balalnce, there's 3 little arrows that points on<br> 3 numbers. Add those 3 numbers and you get the mass of the blue cube.<br>Another name for mass is g(grams). When we place the blue cube in the graduated cylinder,<br>the water rises and the water limit is on the number 68 and you get the volume.<br>Another name for volume is cm3. Also the 3 numbers on the<br>triple beam balance add up to 148.5. Now to find the density of the blue cube,<br> we divide 148.5 by 68, and that equals 2.18 g/cm3.</p>
