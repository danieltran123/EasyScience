                Let's learn about how to find average speed of an object. To find average speed,<br>we have to find the distance and time of the object and divide them.<br>To find the distance and time, we haev to use distance-
            time graphs.</p>

    <div><center><h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>Let's pretetnd a ball is on the picture you just saw. on the black horizontal line,<br>it says time(minutes). On the black vertical line, it says distance(km). The end of the blue line will represent<br>the end of the ball's movement. In the picture, the blue line ends on 60 minutes. The thin line above the end of the blue line,represents the distance our ball stoppedat. In the picture, the distance the end of the blue line<br>hit was 4 km. Now we have to divide the distance(km) by time(minutes), and that equals 0.70 km/minute.</p></center></div>
